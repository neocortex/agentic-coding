# Prime: Load Project Context

## Objective

Build comprehensive understanding of the codebase by analyzing structure, documentation, and key files.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Project Structure

List all tracked files:
!`git ls-files`

Show directory structure:
!`tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|__pycache__|.git|dist|build'`

- Examine the directory structure to understand project organization
- Identify the main entry points and core modules

### 2. Read Core Documentation

- Read CLAUDE.md or similar global rules file
- Read README files at project root and major directories
- Search for and read all other documentation files in the project root and subfolders
- Read any architecture documentation

### 3. Identify Key Files

Based on the structure, identify and read:
- Main entry points (main.py, index.ts, app.py, etc.)
- Core configuration files (*.toml, *.json, *.yaml)
- Key model/schema definitions
- Important service or controller files
- Look for tests to understand expected behavior

### 4. Understand Current State

Check recent activity:
!`git log -10 --oneline`

Check current branch and status:
!`git status`

## Output Report

Provide a concise summary covering:

### Project Overview
- Purpose and type of application
- Primary technologies and frameworks
- Current version/state

### Architecture
- Overall structure and organization
- Key architectural patterns identified
- Important directories and their purposes

### Tech Stack
- Languages and versions
- Frameworks and major libraries
- Build tools and package managers
- Testing frameworks

### Core Principles
- Code style and conventions observed
- Documentation standards
- Testing approach

### Current State
- Active branch
- Recent changes or development focus
- Any immediate observations or concerns

**Make this summary easy to scan - use bullet points and clear headers.**
